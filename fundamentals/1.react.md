# About React

## Key aspects of React

- it uses `.jsx` files for components
- JSX syntax mixes Javascript and HTML
- components are functions
- doesn't offer any styling solution (_althought [Next.js does](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support)_)
- components are stateless by default and may be later upgraded to stateful through _hooks_

## Component example

following the previous workshop example, here it is the React version of a `<Footer />` component ðŸ‘€

```jsx
// Footer.jsx

export const Footer = () => {
  const year = new Date().getFullYear();

  return (
    <footer>
      <p>Copyright Mohole {year}</p>
    </footer>
  );
};
```

**Note:** VSCode supports `.jsx` format out of the box

there are no directives in React, so a loop over an array will look like this:

```jsx
// components/Maccio.jsx

export const Maccio = ({ reverse }) => {
  const trailers = [
    "Italiano medio",
    "Sei personaggi in cerca d'autista",
    "Padre Maronno",
    "Giammangiato",
  ];

  const result = reverse ? trailers.reverse() : trailers;

  return (
    <ul>
      {result.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

// usage
<Maccio reverse={false} />;
```

## Vue ---> React

- `.jsx` and `.vue` files are both Single File Component files, but `.jsx` doesn't have built-in separation of concerns
- it isnt the best practice, but `.jsx` files can have more than one component within
- in React `class=""` becomes `className=""`
- component lifecycle methods are handled by `useEffect()`

## Nuxt ---> Next

- most of Nuxt and Next conventions about folders are the same
- similar to `<NuxtLink />` you need a `<Link />` component to move between pages
- there is an `<Image />` Next component to optimize images (works for stuff on `./public`)
- no auto import
- initial server-side requests are a bit longer to write
- Next is developed by the same team of Vercel

## Client & Server Components

Next.js v13 introduce the concept of **server components**, let's have a deeper look about it in the [official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)...
