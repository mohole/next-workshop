## 02. What is React?

### Copilot definition

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile apps. React allows you to design simple views for each state in your application, and it will efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.

React components are reusable and can manage their own state. So, you can build complex UIs from simple components. It also makes use of a virtual DOM, and provides a performance boost as it reduces direct manipulation of the HTML DOM.

React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, and it's currently maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

### What this actually means

React is a component authoring library. A componennt It's a piece of code that represent a single piece of a UI, ideally a component should be as small as possibile and is responsible of a single atomic activity.

When consumed, a component look like a regular HTML tag but with special name and custom attributes.

```jsx
<Footer year="2024" />
```

Components are like functions but with minor differences:

- they wrap reusable codes
- they may accept values as input
- they always return HTML as output

### Thinking in components

With components we follow a pattern that describes an UI by "slicing" it in small elements and then putting them together like a Lego building.

Components can be splitted in two main categories:

- **stateless** - components that have zero or very simple internal business logic, they are mostly configure from "outside" and are highly reusable
- **stateful** - components that may expose very few visual elements but have important business logic (getting data, coordinating other components, handling side effects)

### JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is primarily used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It looks similar to HTML and allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your JavaScript code, but it has full JavaScript power.

Here's why you can't use React components in plain HTML:

- JSX is **not** HTML: While JSX may look like HTML, it's actually closer to JavaScript. Not all HTML attributes and syntax are valid in JSX. For example, the class attribute becomes className in JSX.
- JSX is transpiled: JSX isn't understood by browsers. It needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel before it can run in a browser.
- React components are JavaScript objects: React components, whether they're written using JSX or not, are ultimately JavaScript objects. These objects manage their own state and lifecycle, and they have a render method that describes what should be displayed.

### How a React component code look like

```jsx
// Footer.jsx

export const Footer = (props) => {
  const year = props.year || 2024;

  return (
    <footer>
      <p>Copyright {year}</p>
    </footer>
  );
};
```
