# Component state

React component state is a way of storing data that can change over time in a React component. It is like a variable that you can use in your component's render method to display different things depending on the state value. You can update the state using the `useState()` hook, which tells React to re-render the component with the new state.

The best way to understand state is with forms. At some point we want to read the value from some input fields and store them in Javascript (and then use it to do something...).

## Forms - the old way

```html
<!-- page.html -->
<input id="text" type="text" />
```

```javascript
// script.js

let text = "";
const input = document.querySelector("#text");

// Reading the value when it change
input.addEventListener("keyp", (event) => {
  text = event.target.value;
});

// Setting the value
input.value = "something";
```

## Forms - the React way

```jsx
// myinput.jsx
import { useState } from "react";

const MyInput = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={text}
      onChange={(event) => setText(event.target.value)}
    />
  );
};
```
