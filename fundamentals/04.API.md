## 04. Application Program Interface

### What is an API?

It is just a fancy acronym to say "how a functionality is exposed to the developers" when we use something like `.querySelector('#something')` we are using a DOM API to retrieve an element from the page giving a CSS selector.

APIs also works as "contracts" to expose the functionality in a predictable way without requiring to know how the underlying code works.

### RESTful APIs

A REST API is a way of communicating with a web server using standard **HTTP methods**.

It stands for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer Application Programming Interface. A REST API allows you to access and manipulate data stored on the server, such as creating, reading, updating or deleting resources.

A REST API usually follows some conventions, such as using JSON or XML as the data format, and using URLs to identify resources (_example:_ `/users/123`)

With this paradigm backend doesn't needd to know which kind of client needs the data and the clients doesn't care about the language used on the backend, as long as they both respect the **data schema as a contract**.

### TL;DR

A REST API is a "special url" that will return raw data instead of pages.
