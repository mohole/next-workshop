## 02. Data structure

![a world driven by data](img/data.webp)

Remember that a **UI** is always a "user interface" to allow users to see and interact with data, so it's extremely important to design the data first and everything else later.

### Remote database

Usually is better to have a local DB and a remote one to be able to work offline and to have 2 different environments, but for simple/small projects we can also opt to always use the same remote DB, bypassing all of the local installations and setup.

### Creating and connecting to the Database

Creation:

- login to Vercel
- from the dashboard click `Storage` from the main menu
- select `Postgres` from the option
- select the location (_`Frankfurt, Germany [fra1]` is the optimal for us_)
- enter the name, we can call it `todo-app`

Connect DB and the Project:

### SQL Queries we are going to use

Create our table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE TodoList (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  text VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  done BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
```

Read all of the data in the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM TodoList
```

Add a new item on the table (and return the generated `id`):

```sql
INSERT INTO TodoList (text, done) VALUES ('Nuovo task', false) RETURNING id
```

Update the done status on a single element giving its unique id:

```sql
UPDATE TodoList SET done = true WHERE id = 1
```

Delete a specific item from the table by its unique id:

```sql
DELETE FROM TodoList WHERE id = 1
```
