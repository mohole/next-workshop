## 03. Server & client components

Think of a React Server Component (RSC) as a special component that lives on the server, not just the client like regular components.

Last time we worked with just RSC, today we are introducing the client components, which in reality are the "real" React components.

| Feature                          | Server components | Client components |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| render on server                 | 游릭                | 游릭                |
| render on client                 | 游댮                | 游릭                |
| can connect to database          | 游릭                | 游댮                |
| have interactivity               | 游댮                | 游릭                |
| "old school" React / Next.js v12 | 游댮                | 游릭                |

### Example

Let's use a `<Timer />` components as an example, once the component is loaded in the page it starts counting the seconds and display the value on the page in **real time**.

```jsx
"use client"; // switch to client components

// client-only React utilities
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export const Timer = () => {
  // Component state
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  // Function the run after the component is mounted
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      // update the value of the state
      setSeconds(seconds + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <section>
      <p>Timer: {seconds}</p>
    </section>
  );
};
```
