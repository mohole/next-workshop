## 01. Project

![workshop poster](img/cover.webp)

We are going to build a small "todo list app" to track simple activities that will use a Postgres SQL database to enable server-side persistance of the data.

This time we are using our own data instead of a 3rd party dataset.

### Final Result

[https://next-workshop-teal.vercel.app/](https://next-workshop-teal.vercel.app/)

### About me

[https://github.com/moebiusmania](https://github.com/moebiusmania)

### Software Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `v20.x` suggested, `v18.x` should be fine
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) (_browser extension_)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) free account and CLI

### What tools we are using

- [React v18](https://react.dev/) - reactive UI library
- [Next.js v14](https://nextjs.org/) - web framework for React
- [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) - normalize browser's default styles
- [tailwindcss-preflight](https://github.com/grievouz/tailwindcss-preflight) - apply some basic global rules
- [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) - remote SQL database
- [Vercel deploy](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) - to publish our application

### A fullstack application in a few hours?

Obviously we are getting some help

- the database is hosted and managed on `vercel.com`, so we just need a small configuration rather than a full setup
- Next.js has also REST API helpers bultin
- CSS is provided in a starter template based on previous lessons

### Starting template

It's a brand new application but built on the concepts of the [previous workshop](https://github.com/mohole/next-workshop/tree/archive/2024/january), so we are not starting everything from scratch but using a "starter" version of this repo:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 -b starter https://github.com/mohole/next-workshop todo-app
```

Command breakdown:

- `git clone` copy a remote repository into our own pc
- `--depth 1` do not clone the whole history, just the last commit (_faster clone and less space used on disk_)
- `-b starter` clone the branch named `starter`
- the URL of the repository to clone
- `todo-app` the name of the folder where the project will be cloned instead of using the name of the repository itself

### What are we going to learn

- React server components vs client components
- managing the state in a React component
- connecting to a SQL database in a Next.js application
- creating a simple full stack application
- high level concepts of automation for publishing
