# User Interface

### Routes

- `/` will just redirect to first channel available
- `/channel/{uuid}` the main application, the `uuid` will tell us which channel data to load

### Server vs Client components

| Feature/Type | Server component | Client component |
|---|---|---|
| code execution | server only (🤯) | server **and** client |
| hydration | ❌ | ✅ |
| interactions | ❌ | ✅ |
| hooks | ❌ | ✅ |
