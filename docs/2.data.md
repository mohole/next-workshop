# Data structure

> Structure the data first, code your app later!

![a Matrix style data warehouse](../_images/data.png)

Key points:

- our data scheme will ben **REALLY** simple
- we will use [UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)s to identify stuff
- database types and TS types are a bit different
- modelling and structure your data before writing code is a good practice to avoid wasting time with refactors because you have changed the data too many times

### Users

### Channels

```typescript
type Channel = {
  uuid: string,       // we are using UUIDs instead of numeric IDs
  name: string,       // users will se this on the screen
  created_at: string,   // just for the records...
}
```

### Messages

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string,       // full name of the user
  photo: string,      // url of the user profile pic
}

type Message = {
  user: User,         // the above object
  text: string,       // the actual text of the message
  timestamp: string,  // date and time of when the message has been sent
  channel: string     // the UUID of the channel where it belongs
}
```
