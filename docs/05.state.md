## 04. Component state

Imagine a React component as a box that displays information. The information inside comes from two sources:

1. **Props**: These are like "inputs" passed to the box from other components. Think of them as labels stuck on the box. They can't be changed by the box itself.

2. **State**: This is like the "content" inside the box, controlled by the box itself. It can be text, images, anything! The important part is that when the state changes, the box automatically updates its display.

Here's the key:

- **State is private**: Only the component knows about its own state.
- **State changes trigger re-renders**: When you update the state using setState, React re-renders the component with the new information.
- **Think of it as dynamic**: State allows components to react to user interactions, timers, or anything that changes the information they display.

> Example: Imagine a counter component. Its state would be a number, and clicking a button would update the state, triggering a re-render with the new count.

Remember, state keeps your components dynamic and responsive to changes!
