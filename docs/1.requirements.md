# Requirements

![How discussing requirements should be..](../_images/req.png)

### Scope

Easily interact with a OpenAI powered language model throught a custom UI resembling a chat application.

### Users journey

We don't have roles or user personas so everyone will follow the same UX:

- users lands on the application
- there is first "welcome message" from the bot
- the user can type a message
- the bot will reply on the provided topic
- all the messages ar rendered as a chat discussion (_similar to Whatsapp, Telegram, etc.._)

the context and the chat history are **not** stored anywhere (_this could be an extra step for a later time_).

### Devices

Let's focus on the mobile experience. Tablet and desktop UIs are a "nice to have" but **not** required.
