# Requirements

![How discussing requirements should be..](../_images/req.png)

### Scope
Fast and easy to use chat app for developers.

Being a developer-friendly solution we will manage new user signup & signin using Github SSO (_Single Sign On_).

### Users journeys

Anonymous user:
- navigate to the app home page
- a chat channel is visible with a CTA to login with Github
- user can't interact with the chat

Not logged in user:
- as previous user plus
- clicking the CTA the Github SSO page appears
- user consent to use the GH account data
- proceed to "Logged in user" flow

Logged in user:
- navigate to the app home page
- a chat channel is visible with the compose message functionality
- the logged in user photo is visible
- user can participate in the discussion
- if she/he wants to logout, it can be done by tapping the profile picture


### Devices
Let's focus on the mobile experience. Tablet and desktop UIs are a "nice to have" but **not** required.
