### Typescript
It's a superset on top of Javascript that add type-safety to ourc code (_which is something that Javascript totally lacks_).

We are not going to use particular features, just for adding simple types and get all of the inherited benefits, for instance:

```typescript
// plain Javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

sum(false, {}) // 'false[object Object]'
```

that's no good, a function built to receive and return `number`s, is receiving a `boolean` and an `object` as parameters and it's returning a `string`. **And for Javascript this is perfectly fine**. 

```typescript
// with Typescript
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

// we will get some errors from TS even before executing the code

sum(false, {}) // this will throw an error
```

### React
It's our component library of choice, it helps us building reactive UI in an efficient and scalable approach.

```javascript
type Props = { name: string }

export const Hello = (props: Props): React.ReactElement => {
  const name: string = props.name || 'User';
  return <h3>Hello {name}</h3>;
}
```

### Next.js
A framework around React that gives us opinionated solutions on stuff like project structure, routing, etc.. and it also adds the SSR capability to our application.

We are going to use `v13.x` and all of the most recent features, mainly the new **app folder** and the new **server components** architecture.

### Tailwind.css
It allows us to work with CSS as a set of class tokens direclty in the markup. This will let us avoid writing a separated file for styling each component.

```html
<h1 class="font-bold text-lg my-3">My application</h1>

<!-- this create larger, bold text with some margins on topo and bottom -->
```

### Daisy UI
A set of UI components built on top of Tailwind.css. They're quite handy when it comes to rapid prototyping but its also extensibile due to theming options.

```html
<div class="chat chat-start">
  <p class="chat-bubble">Hey, this is a message inside a bubble!</p>
</div>

<!-- this will render a chat bubble very similar to most of the ones you see in various chat apps -->
```
