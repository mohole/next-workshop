## 03. Next.js

### Copilot definition

Next.js is a popular open-source React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. It's a production-ready framework that allows developers to quickly build static and dynamic JavaScript applications and provides a great developer experience with features like hot code reloading, automatic routing, and universal server/client code.

Next.js is developed and maintained by Vercel, and it's used by many large companies and brands due to its scalability, performance, and wide range of features. It also supports TypeScript out of the box and has great support for API routes.

### What this actually means

While React is "just" a library that gives us an opinionated way to build components, Next.js is a whole framework that gives us an opinionated way about how to structure and build an entire web application.

Some feature that we are going to use in the project:

- have React components to represent whole pages
- routing
- Server Side Render (_SSR_) of the components

### Next.js 13+

We are taking advantage of the latest Next.js feature mostly related to new application architecture and introduction of React Server Components (_RSC_), so if you will look at previous versions (_12 and below, which as 2024 are the majority of projects_) you will notice that **some parts of the code will differ**, but the overall high-level functionalities are the same.
